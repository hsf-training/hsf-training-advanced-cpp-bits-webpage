This "lesson" is a collection of independent capsules, each addressing a single topic of C++ programming.
Each is a summary of a talk, typically from a major C++ conference, given by an acknowledged C++ expert.
Each lesson contains a link to the talk it summarizes; readers are strongly encouraged to watch the talk
if the summary seems to be interesting.
