This "lesson" is a collection of independent capsules, each addressing a single topic of C++ programming.
Each is a summary of a talk, typically from a major C++ conference, given by an acknowledged C++ expert.
Each lesson contains a link to the talk it summarizes; readers are strongly encouraged to watch the talk
if the summary seems to be interesting.

These capsules are adapted from the Fermilab
[Programming Video Journal Club](https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1164/).
The PVJC meets approximately monthly to discuss a talk on a topic in either C++ or Python programming.
The talks are chosen from major C++ and Python conferences and are available online.
Participants are encouraged to watch the talk before the discussion session, but all are welcome.

The PVJC is not restricted to Fermilab employees or visitors; 
anyone interested in particpating in the PVJC should contact the organizer(s) listed there.
